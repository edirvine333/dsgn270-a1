## A Critique of a Static Website

*by Ed Irvine*

The following is a critique of a static website for a Regina-based contractor named **Iles Electric**.  The site can be found at https://www.ileselectric.com.  The following criteria will be discussed:

- site usability
- visual heirarchy of the site
- mobile friendliness

### SITE USABILITY

> *“If Web pages are going to be effective, they have to work most of their magic at a glance.”* (Krug, 2013)

The site was assessed from this standpoint:  the user has an electrical issue and needs service quickly.  The user does not know of any electrical contractors and is relatively unfamiliar with the internet.  

Upon opening the site, the **Contact Us** link was quickly found in the navigation bar at the top, a common web site convention.  However, the first thing noticed once this page loaded was the Call to Action sending the user back to the home page.  This gives the impression that the page is not functioning, and against the convention of having a link to the home page at the bottom.

The user decided to check services offered next, and the page that opened had a major usability flaw.  There is a small amount of text, a logo, and another Call to Action sending the user back to the home page.  This gave the impression that there was no information regarding services.  However, service information can be found upon scrolling down.  This information should be at the top with other important information and the Call to Action should be at the bottom.

### VISUAL HEIRARCHY

Three visual hierarchy principles were analyzed in this critique, in the following order:

1.  Colour and Contrast
2.  Perspective
3.  Negative Space

The contrast of the paragraphs on the site was good, as it was black text on a white background.  The contrast between the text and the background in the hero headers of the site was poor, because it was white text on a greyscale image.  The colour of the site was bland and there were very few colours used, other than logos and images on the gallery page. 

Perspective was used for some of the hero headers, with the text being placed on a blurred greyscale image.  This helps to bring the text forward somewhat, but the contrast between the text and the background still makes these sections difficult to read.

There was an efficient use of negative space throughout the site, which increased the scannability.  Information was not squeezed together, and the white space around the images in the Gallery was uniform.  

### MOBILE FRIENDLINESS

The site is a responsive site, adjusting to the smaller screen size of a smart phone.  The text aligns into a single column, and the navigation bar becomes vertical and moves to the bottom.  A flaw is that the Call to Action returning the user to the home page ends up near the very top of the column, giving the false impression that the page is over.

There is a flaw in the gallery of the web page.  The width of the images changes from the desktop width so that all four images fit onto the mobile screen.  This functionality should align with the convention of each image resizing to fit a single screen and have the user scroll through the images with their thumb.

### CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the site aligns with many conventions that have become site standards.  There are some design flaws, such as the home page Call to Action location and the improper sizing of the gallery images for the mobile site.  However, the site has a professional look and is user friendly.  Information about the company was easy to find and easy to consume.  For a user who is unfamiliar with the internet and looking for information quickly, this would be a good site for them.
